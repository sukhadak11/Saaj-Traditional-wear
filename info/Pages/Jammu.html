        <p>When the tight part of the suthan, up to the knees, has multiple close fitting folds, the suthan is referred
          to as Dogri pants or Dogri suthan, in Jammu and churidar suthan in Himachal Pradesh. It is also worn in the
          hilly area of the Punjab region. In Jammu, members of all communities wear the suthan.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The city of Jammu is named after Jambu Lochan, the brother of Bahu, a powerful local chieftain who ruled
          during the ninth century. It is said that on becoming king, Jambu Lochan went on a hunt and, crossing the
          Tawi, found a deer and a tiger drinking water from the same tank.</p>

        <h1>For Womens:</h1>
        <h2>Kasaba</h2>
        <p>While Hindu women use Taranga as their head scarf, Muslim women have ‘Kasaba’ which is a red headgear. It is
          red in colour and is traditionally embellished with gold and silver. It is tied like a turban and is pinned by
          trinkets and brooches. It is worn as a regular attire.</p><br>

        <h2>Pheran</h2>
        <p> Just like Hindu women, the traditional dress of Jammu & Kashmir for Muslim women comprises of a Pheran too.
          However, it comes with a slight variation. A Muslim woman’s pheran often comes with a floral pattern or heavy
          Zari embroidery. It is also marked with broad sleeves.</p>

        <h2>Pathani suit</h2>
        <img src="/assets/Kashmiri_man.jpg" alt="img" width="250">
        <p>The traditional clothing for men is long, flowing robes, or long tunics that fully cover the body. While
          Islam outlines a code of modesty, it does not command a particular style, color, or fabric. Although, to dress
          as the Prophet Muhammad and his companions did, is the most preferred method.</p>
