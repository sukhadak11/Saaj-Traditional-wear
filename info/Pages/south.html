        <p>South Indian women traditionally wear the sari while the men wear a type of sarong, which could be either a
          white dhoti or a colourful lungi with typical batik patterns. The saree, being an unstitched drape, enhances
          the shape of the wearer while only partially covering the midriff.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>History of clothing in the Indian subcontinent can be traced to the Indus Valley civilization or earlier.
          Indians have mainly worn clothing made up of locally grown cotton. India was one of the first places where
          cotton was cultivated and used even as early as 2500 BCE during the Harappan era.
          South Indian women traditionally wear the sari while the men wear a type of sarong, which could be either a
          white dhoti or a colourful lungi with typical batik patterns. The saree, being an unstitched drape, enhances
          the shape of the wearer while only partially covering the midriff.

          A sari (sometimes also saree or shari) is a women's garment from the Indian subcontinent, that consists of an
          un-stitched stretch of woven fabric arranged over the body as a robe, with one end attached to the waist,
          while the other end rests over one shoulder as a stole (shawl), sometimes baring a part of the midriff.

        <h2>Ghagra with circular cut</h2>
        <img src="/assets/south 2.avif" alt="wear" width="250">
        <p>The lehenga or ghagra is usually a long skirt with a wide, circular cut that flares out beautifully with
          every twirl. It is paired with a short, tight-fitting blouse called the choli and a long dupatta or scarf
          draped across the front from one shoulder and pinned in place.
          This is not the only type of costume worn for Kathak; the anarkali churidar kameez, named after the famous
          Mughal dancer, is also widely worn for more Mughal inspired performances.

        <h1>For Mens:</h1>
        <h2>Lungi </h2>
        <img src="/assets/Tamilian.jpg" alt="img" width="250">
        <p>The lungi is most popular in areas that have high temperatures. Due to heat and humidity, the lungi is the
          perfect clothing men can wear to sleep, or as casual clothes, instead of tight clothes that turn out to be
          unpleasant and uncomfortable. The lungi is worn mostly by men but women and children can wear it as well.</p>
