        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The history of modest Islamic clothing can be traced back to the 7th century with the advent of the religion of Islam. At the time, the clothing worn by adherents of Islam reflected the traditional dress of the Middle East, featuring loose-fitting garments that covered the body from head to toe.</p>

        <p>The traditional clothing for men is long, flowing robes, or long tunics that fully cover the body. While Islam outlines a code of modesty, it does not command a particular style, color, or fabric. Although, to dress as the Prophet Muhammad and his companions did, is the most preferred method.</p>
