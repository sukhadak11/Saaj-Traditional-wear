        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Nagaland has no early written history, although medieval chronicles of the neighbouring Ahom kingdom of Assam
          tell of the Naga tribes, their economy, and their customs. The 1816 invasion of Assam by Burmans from Myanmar
          led to oppressive Burman rule from 1819 until the establishment of British rule over Assam in 1826.</p>
