        <h2>Bandhani Saree</h2>
        <p>In Gujarat, the Bandhani work has been exclusively carried out by the Khatri community of Kutchh and
          Saurashtra. A meter length of cloth can have thousands of tiny knots known as 'Bheendi' in the local language
          ('Gujarati'). These knots form a design once opened after dyeing in bright colours. Traditionally, the final
          products can be classified into 'khombhi', 'Ghar Chola', 'Chandrakhani', 'Shikari', 'Chowkidaar', 'Ambadaal'
          and other categories.</p>
