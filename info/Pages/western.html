        <p>Western wear is a clothing style derived from 19th century American old west region. Jeans, t-shirts, and jackets are the prevalent clothing forms of this style among men and women. This category of clothes is widely accepted by many cultures, as they offer comfort, durability, and variety.</p></br>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>In 2012, Goan designer Wendell Rodricks stated that “Indo-western clothing originated in Goa.” On December 31, 1600, Queen Elizabeth I formally allowed trade in the East Indies to The Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies. This was a strategic move to compete in the Dutch controlled spice trade.</p>

        <h1>For Womens:</h1>
        <h2>Bengali Saree</h2><br>
        <img src="/assets/indo-westen.jpg" alt="wear Image" width="250">
        <p>Such clothes also made outdoor activities like hunting etc very comfortable and convenient for the Indian princes and kings too. This Indo western blend gave rise to outfits like Jodhpuri suits, the bandhgala kurta, waistcoat style jackets, the sherwani, the achkan jacket etc.</p><br>
       <h2>Crop-top and jeans</h2>
        <img src="/assets/jeans.jpg" alt="wear Image" width="250">

        <p>Western wear typically incorporates one or more of the following, Western shirts with pearl snap fasteners and vaquero design accents, blue jeans, cowboy hat, a leather belt, and cowboy boots. </p>

        <img src="/assets/IndoWestern-for-Men-ws.jpg" alt="img" width="250">
        <p>We have explored different kinds of floral sherwanis in the past. However, in this case, Kartik Aryan is flaunting an ethnic waistcoat – a quintessential Indo western for men look – with floral motifs. The black and white look is enhanced by the multicolor flowers embroidered on the waistcoat! The brown leather boots also go well with the attire.</p>

        <h2>Simple Indo Western</h2>
        <img src="/assets/bengali-dress-for-men-min.jpg" alt="img" width="250">
        <p>Nothing can be more royal, nothing can be more masculine and nothing can be classier than a well-tailored, well-fitted galabandh suit in solid colors paired with posh leather shoes! This is the basic rule of the game when it comes to Indo western for men. This picture proves that a white Jodhpuri suit with a black trouser can make you look like royalty, effortlessly!
