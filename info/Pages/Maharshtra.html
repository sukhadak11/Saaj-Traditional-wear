       <p> Fashion in Maharashtra, a western state in India, is a vibrant and diverse blend of traditional and contemporary
        styles. Maharashtra is home to the bustling city of Mumbai, often referred to as the fashion capital of India,
        which greatly influences the fashion scene in the state.</br></p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Historically, the women of the Maratha Empire showcased their abilities and caliber by assisting their fellow
          male warriors during the times of war. Hence, in order to accomplish their mission and yet maintain their
          comfort of physical movement during the wars, these Marathi women invented this Maharashtrian style of drape.

        <h1>For Womens:</h1>
        <h2>Navari</h2><br>
        <img src="/assets/saree.jpg" alt="wear Image" width="250">
        <p>Traditional Maharashtrian attire reflects the rich cultural heritage of the region. The iconic nine-yard
          saree
          known as the Navari or Nauvari saree is a significant part of Maharashtrian fashion. It is draped in a unique
          way, with the saree tucked at the back, allowing for greater freedom of movement. The saree is typically
          paired
          with traditional Maharashtrian jewelry such as the nath (nose ring), chandrakor bindi (moon-shaped forehead
          decoration), and Kolhapuri saaj</p><br>

        <h2>Sarre</h2>

        <br>
        <p>The Sarre is a traditional Maharashtrian saree worn An additional significance of the sari is to symbolize
          national pride in India. For the sake of preserving Indian culture, it may be obligatory for girls to wear the
          sari. Women in India wear the saree as a symbol of pride in their nation and culture.</p>
        <br>
        <h2> Paithani</h2>
        <img src="/assets/saree1.webp" alt="wear Image" width="250">
        <p>Paithani is a sari made of silk and zari. It is a plain weave, with weft figuring designs according to the
          principles of tapestry. Traditionally, Paithanis had a coloured, cotton muslin field that often contained
          considerable supplementary zari patterning. However, in the 19th century, silk fields were also woven.</p><br>
        <h1>For Mens:</h1>
        <img src="/assets/dhoti.webp" alt="img">
        <p>The men in rural Maharashtra are seen wearing a Dhotar or Dhoti. A Dhoti is a single piece of cloth tucked
          around the waist. Dhoti covers the entire leg till the ankle. The colour of Dhotis usually ranges from
          saffron, cream or white.</p>
        <p>Overall, fashion in Maharashtra is a dynamic blend of tradition and innovation. From traditional
          Maharashtrian
          attire to contemporary designs inspired by global trends, the state offers a diverse range of fashion choices.
          With its rich cultural heritage, thriving fashion industry, and a growing focus on sustainability, Maharashtra
          continues to make a significant contribution to the fashion landscape in India and beyond.</p>
