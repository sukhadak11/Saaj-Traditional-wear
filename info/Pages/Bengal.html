        <p>The panjabis or the kurtas are usually made of silk or cotton and run up to knee length. The lungi happens to
          be another variation of the men's costume. However that is more of an informal casual indoor wear. Saree is
          the signature traditional attire for the women in West Bengal.</p></br>

        <h2>History</h2>

          References to it occur in early Sanskrit literature, but its early history is obscure until the 3rd century
          bce, when it formed part of the extensive Mauryan empire inherited by the emperor Ashoka.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Going back to the British Era, the traditional dress of Kolkata for men included a white dhoti paired with
          colored of the printed kurta. With the advent of contemporary times, the dhotis are no longer bleak plain
          whites instead, they have become a fashion statement.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Punjabi Dhoti</h2>
        <img src="/assets/bengali-dress-for-men-min.jpg" alt="img" width="250">
        <p>Interestingly, the traditional attire of Kolkata men is called ‘Panjabi.’ The dhoti is often paired with a
          Kurta or long top with full sleeves. Ideally suited for warm summer months, the traditional dress of men in
          Bengal is airy, breezy, and, most importantly, comfortable to wear</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Lungi</h2>
        <img src="/assets/bengalilungi-min.jpg" alt="img" width="250">
        <p>With a variety of colors, fabrics, and prints available specifically for dhotis, men have a good time playing
          up their dressing game in the City of love. One stroll on the streets of Kolkata, and you will barely see
          anyone wearing the same old white dhoti & kurta</p><br>
        <p>The traditional dress of West Bengal for men also includes a Lungi. It is a kind of pant that is tied around
          the waist like a dhoti.
          The comfortable and casual vibes of the Lungi make it an excellent choice for everyday use in the state of
          West Bengal.</p>
