        <p>The history of Assam has passed several stages of development to reach to its present state. The history of
          Assam can be divided into four eras.Assam is the meeting ground of diverse cultures. The people of the
          enchanting state of Assam are an intermixture of various racial stocks such as Mongoloid, Indo-Burmese,
          Indo-Iranian and Aryan. The Assamese culture is a rich and exotic tapestry of all these races evolved through
          a long assimilative process.</p>
