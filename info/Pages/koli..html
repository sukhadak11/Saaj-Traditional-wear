        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Koli is an agriculturist caste of Gujarat but in coastal areas they also work as fishermen along with
          agriculture. In the beginning of 20th century, the Koli caste was recognised as a Criminal Tribe under
          Criminal Tribes Act by British Indian government because of their anti-social activities during World War I.
