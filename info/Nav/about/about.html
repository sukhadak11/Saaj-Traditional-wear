            world, which enables users to create, organize, tag, comment, and manage their own fashion page on the

            world.</p>
        <p>Saaj offers its users a unique opportunity to be famous and make money from publishing their own fashion
            contents (brands and styles) for people to see, contact, order, and buy. They can also make more money by
            sharing and tagging other people's fashion brands and products on the platform.</p>
        <p>At Saaj, we inspire you every day! You can share your daily fashion looks from your mobile devices and tag
            the brands you're wearing directly from the fashion platform for people to see and comment.</p>
        <p>You can find and follow top-ranked fashion celebrities, bloggers, models, designers, photographers, brands,
            etc., from all over the world to keep up with the latest style and fashion trends.</p>
        <p>Find out what's trending this season! Search looks by hashtags, brands, products, and specific users.</p>

        <p>Make money while having fun!</p>
        <p>Everyone can make money by tagging products with links directly to their stores or by using affiliate
            programs (Saaj does not take a cut of your commission, so you receive 100% commissions). You're incentivized
            to share not only who makes that cool dress, shoes, bracelet, etc., but also where to buy it. You will be
            able to support the brands and influencers you love not just by your likes and follows but when you purchase
            products from their photos.</p>
        <p>All advice and suggestions are highly welcome. Please feel free to leave us a message and contact us.</p>
